##  Salifort Motors Project-HR Analytics & Attrition Prediction(Capstone Project)

**Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn), Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Description**:

- Cleaned and explored HR dataset to identify factors contributing to employee attrition, including satisfaction level, project load, hours worked, and tenure.
- Built and compared predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest); **RF achieved ~96% accuracy, ~0.94 AUC.**
- Produced visualizations and feature importances that highlight overworked employees, tenure effects, and evaluation score impacts.
- Delivered actionable recommendations to HR based on the modeling and EDA.

**Deliverables**:
- **Salifort motors-capstone.py** → End-to-end data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
- **PACE Strategy Document** → Planning and analysis framework documenting problem definition, approach, and ethical considerations.  
- ****Summary Report** (PDF)**→ Key visualizations, model performance metrics, feature importance charts, and HR recommendations.
